<h1>About Greedo</h1>
(from wookiepedia)

<p>was a male Rodian bounty hunter who grew up on Tatooine in Mos Espa. During the Clone Wars,
  he was hired by the Trade Federation to kidnap Chi Eekway Papanoida and Che Amanwe Papanoida,
  the daughters of Chairman Papanoida, but was forced by the chairman to lead him and his son,
  Ion to them. He was occasionally hired by crime lord Jabba the Hutt for various mercenary jobs,
  including the capture of Han Solo, who killed the luckless Rodian.</p>

  <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <p>Originally hailing from the swamp planet of Rodia, during his youth, Greedo relocated and
      lived on the desert planet of Tatooine. After the slave boy Anakin Skywalker won the famous
      Boonta Eve Classic, beating the renowned Dug racer Sebulba, Greedo jumped to the conclusion
      that he had cheated. Angered by the false accusation, Skywalker consequently found himself
      entangled in a fight with the young Rodian. The fellow young Rodian Wald warned Greedo that
      if he continued to pick on fights, he would eventually meet with a bad end.</p>

  <h2>Criminal Career</h2>
    <p>By the Clone Wars, Greedo was employed to Jabba the Hutt as a bounty hunter. At some point
      in the war, he and another mercenary were hired by the Trade Federation to kidnap Chairman
      Papanoida's daughters, Che Amanwe and Chi Eekway, to use as leverage for Pantora to join the
      Confederacy of Independent Systems. In the ensuing struggle, Che struck Greedo with an idol,
      covering its base with the Rodian's green blood. After finding this blood sample while
      investigating his daughter's kidnapping, Chairman Papanoida and his son, Ion tracked the
      bounty hunter to Jabba's Palace and presented the evidence to Jabba, who then forced Greedo
      to bring the Pantorans to the cantina in Mos Eisley where Che was being held. In the ensuing
      firefight, Greedo managed to slip away while the family gunned down the rest of Che's captors.</p>
