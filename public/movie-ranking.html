<h1>The Best Star Wars films According to yours truly</h1>

<h2>My top 3 episodes from George Lucas of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</h3>

<p>
This was the first film I have ever watched that made me cry because of the strong emotions I have felt from
the event that happened in this episode. The CGI might be a bit dull and whacky but it has its charm once you
give it a second go and possibly watch the Clone wars series.

<h3>Star Wars: Episode V - Empire Strikes Back</h3>

<p>
This film was the first time that I felt that what I am watching was truly a Star Wars film due to the fact
that it tackled various planets. Most notably are Koth, a planet covered in ice and when the AT-AT were first
revelead, and Dagobah, a swamp planet where Yoda hid after order 66.

<h3>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</h3>

<p>
The OGest of all OG. A New Hope is where it all started and is indeed a very fun, rewatchable and goofy sci-fi
film to watch with someone you would like to introduce to Star Wars with. I love the original Luke, Leia and
Han trio with C3P0 and R2D2 duo. This is also where Darth Vader had his first menacing appearance and it still
gives me goosebumps up to this date.
